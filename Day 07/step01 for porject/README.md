# Step 1

Your goal is to build a Hangman game using everything you have learnt about Python programming.

## Demo Final Project

https://appbrewery.github.io/python-day7-demo/

The project is split into 5 major steps. In each step, there will be multiple TODOs. Your goal is to go through each todo in order and complete them.

You can view all the todos easily in PyCharm by going to View -> Tool Windows -> TODOs

## TODO-1

Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word. Then print it.

## TODO-2

Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make the String stored in guess lowercase.

### Hint 1

Search Google for the lower() function in Python.

## TODO-3

Check if the letter the user guessed guess is one of the letters in the chosen_word. Loop through each of the letters in the chosen_word and print "Right" if the letter is a match, "Wrong" if it's not.

### Hint 2:

You can loop through Strings the same way you can loop through Lists - by using the `for in` loop. Try Googling: "Loop through strings python"
