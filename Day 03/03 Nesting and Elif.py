# BMI Calculator with Interpretations
# Add some if/elif/else statements to the BMI calculator so that it interprets the BMI values calculated.

# If the bmi is under 18.5 (not including), print out "underweight"
#
# If the bmi is between 18.5 (including) and 25 (not including), print out "normal weight"
#
# If the bmi is 25 (including) or over, print out "overweight"
#
