# ['Strawberries', 'Nectarines', 'Apples', 'Grapes', 'Peaches', 'Cherries', 'Melons', 'Lemons']


# Question 3:
# Given the code below:

fruits = ["Strawberries", "Nectarines", "Apples",
          "Grapes", "Peaches", "Cherries", "Pears"]
vegetables = ["Spinach", "Kale", "Tomatoes", "Celery", "Potatoes"]

dirty_dozen = [fruits, vegetables]

print(dirty_dozen[1][1])
# What will be printed?


# What's going on?

# This question combines several of the Python List concepts that weâ€™ve seen in the previous lessons in isolation. If the code above is at all confusing, I recommend breaking down whatâ€™s going on using several print statements using repl.it. First, try printing out:

print(dirty_dozen)
# Then print out:

print(dirty_dozen[0])
print(dirty_dozen[1])
# To see what happens at the next stage print out:

print(dirty_dozen[1][2])
print(dirty_dozen[1][3])
# I hope this helps clarify how nested lists work. ðŸ™‚
